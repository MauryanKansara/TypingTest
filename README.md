# Typing test website ⌨️

This is a Typing Test website in which there will be a random quote displayed and when user starts typing, a counter begins and when user completes typing it stops. It uses [api.quotable.io](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) to fetch random quotes. User's highest score is stored to their local storage and gets updated everytime user makes a new high score.

Here is the live demo of the webiste: https://mauryankansara.github.io/TypingTest/
